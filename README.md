## Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, versatile, and easy-to-read programming language. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, automation, artificial intelligence, and more. Pythonâ€™s simple syntax and readability make it a great choice for beginners.

## Predefined Keywords

**Keywords** are reserved words in Python that have special meanings. They cannot be used as variable names. Examples include `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`, etc.

To get a list of all keywords in Python:
```python
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
```

## Mutability & Immutability

- **Mutable objects** can be changed after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets).
- **Immutable objects** cannot be changed after creation (e.g., strings, tuples, integers).

Example:
```python
# Mutable
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[0] = 10  # This works

# Immutable
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple[0] = 10  # This will give an error
```

---

## Operators

Python supports several types of operators:
- **Arithmetic Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`
- **Comparison Operators:** `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- **Logical Operators:** `and`, `or`, `not`
- **Assignment Operators:** `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.

---

## Type Casting

Type casting is converting one data type to another. Common functions:
- `int()`
- `float()`
- `str()`
- `bool()`

Example:
```python
a = "5"
b = int(a)  # b is now an integer 5
```

---

## Conditionals

Conditionals allow your code to make decisions based on conditions.

Example:
```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")
```

---

## Loops

Loops are used for repeated execution of a block of code.
- **For loop:** Iterates over a sequence.
- **While loop:** Repeats as long as a condition is true.

Examples:
```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```
